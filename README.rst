Purpose
-------
Hydrolink refers to the linkage of spatial data to a stream network.  This is similar to the analogy of providing an addresses on a road network and provides context to the hydrographic network allowing for integration of information into a common spatial framework/context.  This package accepts point data and HydroLinks to versions of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) using MapServices. Two versions of the NHD are currently supported including the NHDPlusV2.1 Medium Resolution and the NHD High Resolution. 

Requirements
------------
Requirements.txt shows condensed version of packages, while requirements_dev shows a full list of packages used in development.

Getting Started
---------------
Install the package

* pip install git+https://github.com/dwief-usgs/hydrolink.git

Using the hydrolinker command line tool you can HydroLink all points in a CSV file.  

* Access help menu -> python -m hydrolink.hydrolinker --help
* Example running with default options ->  python -m hydrolink.hydrolinker --input_file=file_name.csv

Two Jupyter Notebooks are included to show a few basic capabilities for both NHD versions.

* example-using-single-point-nhd-high-resolution.ipynb -> Jupyter notebook with descriptions on how to run hydrolink methods on NHD High Resolution for a single point location.
* example-using-single-point-nhd-medium-resolution.ipynb -> Jupyter notebook with descriptions on how to run hydrolink methods on NHDPlusV2.1 for a single point location.
