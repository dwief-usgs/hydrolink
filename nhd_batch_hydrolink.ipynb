    "# Batch HydroLink \n",
    "## Developed By: Daniel Wieferich (USGS)\n",
    "## 20171005\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note: This code is a work in progress.  Any suggestions and comments are welcomed.\n",
    "#### Also an issue was detected in the NHD High Resolution Services, which is returning no data when it should not.  This is currently being investigated with the NHD team.\n",
    "\n",
    "### This code performs a hydrolink batch process on a text file (.csv ) or shapefile (.shp) using user defined latitude and longitude fields.  The code returns the reachcode and measure of the closest position on the High Resolution National Hydrography Dataset and the Medium Resolution NHDPlusV2.1 using web services.  The code also uses snap distance and stream name to help quantify a level of certainty.  Levels of certainty currently exist only for the NHDPlusV2.1, due to the availability of needed information from current web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next steps: \n",
    "1. Work with the NHD High Resolution team to see if additional information can be returned from services to help with assigning a level of certainty. (in progress)\n",
    "2. It would be great to get a measure of distance to closest confluence as a measure of certainty.  Through manual linkage in the past I've noticed that points within 50m of a confluence are more likely to link to the wrong reach.\n",
    "3. The current code assumes lat/lon are in NAD83.  The code should be altered to accept various crs inputs.\n",
    "4. Improve upon error checking and notifications\n",
    "5. Allow for join of hydro-linked data to original dataset?"
